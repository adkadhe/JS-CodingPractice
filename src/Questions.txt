1 FizzBuzz: 
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, 
and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

2 Palindrome Checker: 
Write a program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). 
The program should return true if the string is a palindrome and false otherwise.

3 Fibonacci Sequence: 
Write a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. 
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, 
usually starting with 0 and 1.

4 Prime Number Checker: 
Write a program that checks whether a given number is prime (only divisible by 1 and itself). 
The program should return true if the number is prime and false otherwise.

5 Reverse a String: Write a program that reverses a given string. 
For example, if the input is "hello", the program should return "olleh".

6 Capitalize Letters: 
Write a program that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a given string. 
For example, if the input is "hello world", the program should return "Hello World".

7 Caesar Cipher: 
Implement the Caesar cipher, which is a simple encryption technique. 
The program should take a string and a shift value and return the encrypted string by shifting each letter 
by the specified value in the alphabet.

8 Factorial Calculator: 
Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number. 
The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

9 Random Number Generator: 
Write a program that generates a random number between a specified minimum and maximum value.

10 Shopping Cart: 
Implement a simple shopping cart program. 
The program should allow adding items, removing items, and calculating the total price of the items in the cart.

Note : These programs cover a range of concepts and can help you practice different aspects of JavaScript programming. Happy coding!
